# Harmony Protocol

**Harmony Protocol** is a decentralized smart contract system for controlled resource distribution on the Stacks blockchain. It supports advanced allocation mechanisms with time-locks, multi-factor verification, anomaly detection, and emergency intervention ‚Äî making it ideal for sensitive or high-value asset management.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Multi-Stage Verification**  
  Includes explicit acceptance, 2FA for high-value transfers, and manual approval processes.

- ‚è≥ **Time-Locked Releases**  
  Schedule phased allocations with a defined release timeline.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Anomaly Detection & Circuit Breakers**  
  Configure protected allocations with thresholds and block-wise transaction caps.

- üßä **Emergency Freeze & Locking**  
  Freeze or lock allocations in case of threats or security investigations.

- üîÅ **Trusted Recovery Mechanism**  
  Recover stuck or unclaimed allocations with supervisor-controlled cooldowns.

- üîí **Rate-Limited Withdrawals**  
  Enforce withdrawal rate caps on large allocations for added safety.

## üß± Architecture

- `AllocationRepository` - Tracks all allocations and their metadata
- `last-allocation-identifier` - Ensures unique tracking of allocations
- Supervisor privileges handled via `PROTOCOL_SUPERVISOR`
